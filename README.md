# Ads Manager Front End

## Overview

This the front end section. I did it in one seating in approx 40 mins. Of course a lot more can be done in terms of scalabilty but I think given my limited time I was able to showcase my skills with the technology. I have used both class and function components in different parts for example. The front end of course consumes the back end apis. My suggestions for impormvment are in the todo section.

**DISCLAIMER: I know it is bad practice to push everything at one go yet I believe its also futile to repeat and create branch and micro commits since this is a very small project itself. I have done the methodic way of pushing in the back end apis project with proper micro commits and pull requests kindly refer to apis project.**
